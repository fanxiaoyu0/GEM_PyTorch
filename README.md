<center><h1>GEM in PyTorch</h1></center>

This project is a **unofficial** PyTorch implementation of [Geometry enhanced molecular representation learning for property prediction](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-021-00438-4) paper. It should be noted that everything should still be based on [PaddleHelix](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleHelix/tree/dev/apps/pretrained_compound/ChemRL/GEM) official code, and this project does not guarantee that the experimental results will be completely consistent with the original GEM model.

Follow the prompts in `/data/temp/env.sh` to configure the required environment.

You can run the sample project using `python main.py`.
